# albumcolors
These color palettes were recreated by RJ Andrews during Advent 2019 from the late 1800s French _Album de Statistique Graphique_. The original album maps are one of the highest achievements in thematic mapping. Visit [DavidRumsey](https://www.davidrumsey.com/luna/servlet/view/search?sort=Pub_List_No_InitialSort%2CPub_Date%2CPub_List_No%2CSeries_No&q=album+de+statistique&search=Go) to see each original map in its full glory.

Each recreated palette is comprised of several SVG patterns. SVGs are located in the [Patterns folder](https://github.com/infowetrust/albumcolors/tree/master/patterns). Each SVG pattern is named by its Rumsey List Number and sequence in parent palette.

Overview documentation of palettes is in the [Previews folder](https://github.com/infowetrust/albumcolors/tree/master/previews). Each palette has a preview image + CSV with Rumsey list number, 2019 Advent day it was originally published, what type of palette scheme it is, and how many patterns it contains.
 
Let me know on Twitter [@infowetrust](https://twitter.com/infowetrust) if you make anything using these palettes. If there is interest I may expand beyond the existing four palettes and add additional documentation about map styling including a note on typefaces.
